scalable, loosely-coupled, testable, server-side application written with TypeScript and the NestJS framework. Rent-A-Car is a demonstrative car rental web application for authorized users to list their vehicle as available for rental, and to find rental vehicles available in their area. The application uses the powerful HERE Developer Geocoder API to create rentals with geocoordinate location data as well as to search for listed rentals near a user's address or device location. User profile and rental images are uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket, and the image download links and metadata are saved to a MongoDB Atlas cluster. Once a user has listed a rental, they may upload photos, edit the rental's pricing, schedule unavailability on the calendar, and update the rental's details.\nInstallation\nTry the App with Postman:\n\n\nNote: If Postman Web never launches try downloading the app to your pc, it will import the collection and environment and run fine. \nwill be deployed soon :)\n\nContributing\n\nJonathan Sells\nThis project is a smaller demonstrative version of the original project Turrendas that I was working on with Jean Canales, who was creating the React frontend.\n\nLicense\nThis project is licensed under the MIT license.
