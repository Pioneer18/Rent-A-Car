# Rent-A-Car
This project is a demonstration of a scalable, loosely-coupled, testable, server-side application written with TypeScript and the NestJS framework. Rent-A-Car is a demonstrative car rental web application for authorized users to list their vehicle as available for rental, and to find rental vehicles available in their area. The application uses the powerful HERE Developer Geocoder API to create rentals with geocoordinate location data as well as to search for listed rentals near a user's address or device location. User profile and rental images are uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket, and the image download links and metadata are saved to a MongoDB Atlas cluster. Once a user has listed a rental, they may upload photos, edit the rental's pricing, schedule unavailability on the calendar, and update the rental's details.
